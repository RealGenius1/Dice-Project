    <string name="help_text">Winnie-the-Pooh heard a strange noise—a buzzing noise. He looked up and saw a beehive high in a tree. \'Oh bother,\' he thought. \'If only I could climb up there and get some honey!\'. “Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws and began to think”. Help Winnie-the-Pooh climb to the top of the tree and reach the beehive on Branch 30 before his honey cravings get the best of him! Each turn, roll two animated dice to determine how many branches he climbs. However, watch out for tricky obstacles!</string>
